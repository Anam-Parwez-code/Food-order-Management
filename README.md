## 🧠 Development Methodology

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Development
I utilized **AI (Gemini)** as a "Pair Programmer" throughout this project to:
- **Accelerate Debugging:** Quickly diagnosed and resolved deployment issues (500/404 errors) on Vercel.
- **Code Optimization:** Refactored React components and TypeScript interfaces for better readability and performance.
- **Configuration:** Streamlined the connection between frontend and backend using environment variables.

### 🧪 TDD (Test Driven Development) Mindset
I followed a TDD-inspired workflow to ensure code quality:
- **Red-Green-Refactor:** Defined functionality requirements first, implemented them, and then refined the code.
- **Independent API Testing:** Verified backend routes using API testing tools before frontend integration to ensure data integrity.
- **Component Isolation:** Kept logic for cart operations and UI rendering separate for easier maintenance and future testing.
